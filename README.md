# Cahier Canada

A project to design a note-taking web app aimed at deepening my knowledge of JavaScript. The main focuses of the project are **accessibility**, **performance**, and **customization**.

### Accessible
From portable devices to high-definition screens, every feature must be accessible, easy to use, and functional for people with auditory, visual, or other impairments.

### Performant
Optimize every feature and line of code to ensure fluidity on any device, enhancing accessibility and improving the user experience.

### Customizable
Allow users to personalize app elements, fine-tune details, and create an experience tailored to their preferences and needs.
